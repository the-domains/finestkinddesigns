This is my 5th blog, if you count the humble beginnings on MySpace. I like to change things up now and then!

I've taken a good long break, though; my last post was at the end of the summer season, 2014\. Because Life. Because Boys. Because Margin.

What's kicked things off, this time around? Three things; my youngest is now 5\. Facebook keeps throwing up memories of blog life, and I realize how precious those posts are. And two ladies that welcomed me into their project, prompting me to realize again, the beauty of creating while mothering. I am so very eager to get my hands on their book!

.....

What was God thinking when He created you creative and then gave you children? Creative moms often feel as though they must lay their passions down. But God had something special in mind for the creative woman during this intense season of mothering.

In this Pinterest age of handcrafted children's parties, Instagram photos of beautifully decorated homes, and blogs filled with poetry and prose, it is clear that we are in the midst of a brand new artistic renaissance. Not one born in Italian cathedrals or Harlem jazz clubs, but rather in kitchens, nurseries, and living rooms around the world. Mothers, working in the cracks and crevices of each hectic day, are adorning the world with their gifts, and they're showing all of us the beauty of this Life Creative.

In this book, you'll learn:

* Why the world needs your art
* How this Life Creative begins at home
* When art can turn a profit
* Your part in this modern day Renaissance

Life Creative paints the stories of moms, just like you, who are fitting their inspired lives into the everyday, ordinary places of motherhood. Women like home decorator Melissa Michaels and jewelry designer Lisa Leonard, author Angie Smith, recording artist Ellie Holcomb, and many more.

.....

It's written by the generous Wendy and Kelly, and is available here.

So, yeah...I'm feeling that creative energy making a comeback.
