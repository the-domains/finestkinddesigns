"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full"-Jesus

This life is not all pretty, friends. But my Jesus makes it the Finest Kind. Through the ups and the downs and ugly and the beautiful; I believe He instilled in all of us the desire to create and appreciate beautiful things and moments...to give us hope.

This site is home to my journey and creations, and I hope that it inspires you to seek out the little experiences that make YOUR life the Finest Kind.

As for me?

I'm a Maine girl, by way of New Mexico. I've had little roots in Arizona and Texas and Virginia as well, but Maine has my heart, by far. My husband and I have 3 boys, and we love to enjoy each other and explore the wilds of our little corner of the earth. We live in an amazing small town, and hope mightily for a piece of land by the water someday.

I smile big when I get into bed at night, but can't wait to wake up for my coffee in the morning. I prefer iced tea in the afternoon. I'm truly inspired when I get outside, so I can't wait to get home and create, but then am eager to get back out again.

I'm as anti Type A as possible, and a bit of a cultural rebel. I'm a laid back, recovering perfectionist. I cringe at small talk but truly love people and having deep conversations. I champion the underdog.

I homeschool my boys; my science whiz and artist and ninja. They are a crazy, loud, intense delight.

I'm a creative at heart and always have been. I like to take pictures and paint and putter around with pottery. I like to make jewelry and fuss with laser creations. I wish I could stick with just one thing, but apparently, it's not possible.
